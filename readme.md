# 📚 OOPS Concepts - Java

Welcome to my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** learning repository in Java!  
This project contains notes and basic example programs I created to understand core OOPs concepts.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- **Abstraction**  
- **Inheritance**  
- **Polymorphism**  
- **Encapsulation**

## 💡 About

Each concept includes:
- Simple Java code examples  
- Explanations in comments  
- Practice files to help understand the basics clearly

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swetagoswami819/OOPS-Concepts-Java.git

Open the .java files in your favorite IDE (e.g., VSCode, Eclipse).

Run the examples and try modifying them to practice.

📖 Why This Project

This is my personal learning repository to help me revise OOPs anytime and share my learning journey publicly.
It will also help recruiters see my basic coding skills during placements.
